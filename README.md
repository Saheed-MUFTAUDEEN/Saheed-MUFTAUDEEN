**Engineer in Data Space** 

I am a self-taught Data Scientist with background in Engineering building my skills one step at a time. My transition to data space stem from a desire to solve real-life problems with data. 

To acquire the real world work experience, I am currently an intern at Hamoye AI Lab where I partcipate in a number of industry use case capstone projects. Please, feel free to connect with me; I am more than happy to chat!

I am on phone with my beautiful wife, lol.


Cheers!!
