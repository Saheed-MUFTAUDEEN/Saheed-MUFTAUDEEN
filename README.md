## *Hi, welcome to my GitHub page. I am Muftaudeen Saheed.*

I am a self-taught Data Analyst / Data Scientist with background in Engineering building my skills one step at a time. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed a strong foundation in mathematical and computational methods, as well as an aptitude for problem-solving and critical thinking. My transition to data space stem from a desire to solve real-life problems with data. 

Currently, I am an intern at Hamoye AI lab where I am gaining hands-on experience in applying data science techniques to real-world problems. I am honing my skills in data preprocessing, statistical modeling, and machine learning, with a focus on using these tools to make informed decisions and drive business outcomes.

I am passionate about using data to uncover insights and drive change, and I am always looking for new ways to expand my knowledge and capabilities in this field. My goal is to leverage my technical skills and analytical mindset to make an impact as a data analyst and data scientist.I also take interest in open-source technologies and enjoy contributing to them. I have a good understanding of data visualization tools such as Tableau and Power BI. 

Finally, I am always eager to learn new things and improve my skills, and I believe that the best way to do so is by sharing knowledge and collaborating with others in the community.

Please, feel free to connect with me; I am more than happy to chat!
