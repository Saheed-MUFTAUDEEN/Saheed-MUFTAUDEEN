**Engineer in Data Space** 

I am a self-taught Data Scientist with background in Engineering building my skills one step at a time. My transition to data space stem from a desire to solve real-life problems with data. 

To acquire the real world work experience, I am currently an intern at Hamoye AI Lab where I partcipate in a number of industry use case capstone projects. Please, feel free to connect with me; I am more than happy to chat!


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Analysis of COVID-19 dataset
- âš¡ Fun fact: Bachelorâ€™s degrees in data science were practically non-existent five years ago, according to Discover Data Science. Now over 50 higher education institutions in the United States currently offer one.
